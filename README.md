* 1.How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution?
I decided to use axios, as it is a clear way to fetch data, even though for a simple application like this, it would have been better to use the build-it fetch API

* 2.Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
Yes, there are some things that could be done more efficient, like using GraphQL and real DB, Mongo, for this type of application, making a separate file for the API calls and adding a baseUrl for the API.

* 3.What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
Working a little more on the UI/UX as it isn't fully responsive at the moment and adding comments to some of the lines, althought the code seems to be really intuitive at the moment, and also working a little more at the loading screens(the time when the data from the api did not arrive yet).
